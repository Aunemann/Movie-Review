                <h2>The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind</h2>
                <p>William Kamkwamba is the main character of the movie.</p> <hr> <p>William Kamkwamba is also a real person because the film is based off his story and how he managed to create electricity.</p>
<hr>
<p>The plot is about a young boy who cant afford school because of the dry season for the crops his family produce. In return there becomes a shortage of food in the village and people begin stealing from eachother. He wants to make electricity for the village so they can have running water through the crops. </p>
<hr>
<p>The setting is located in a village in Kasung, Malawi. It is really dry and people struggle to live there.</p>
<hr>
<p>The movie's Genre is Family/Drama and I think that fits the movie pretty well.</p>
